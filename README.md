# Scenario Description:

Our project serves as a project managament platform.

Landowner initiates project: 
The owner of a property seeks to develop the land by constructing a building.

Consults with an architectural firm: 
The landowner approaches an architecture firm to design detailed plans for the building, which include structural, aesthetic, and functional aspects.

Engages a general contractor: 
Once the architectural plans are finalized, the landowner hires a general contractor to manage and oversee the construction process.

General contractor manages subcontractors: 
The general contractor takes on the responsibility of coordinating various specialized trades, such as electricians, plumbers, and other subcontractors, ensuring the project adheres to the approved plans and timeline.

Subcontractor execution: 
Each subcontractor performs their specific duties (e.g., electrical wiring, plumbing, etc.) under the supervision and guidance of the general contractor to complete the project efficiently and within scope.

Project completion: 
The general contractor ensures that all work is completed to the required standards, and the building is ready for occupancy or use by the landowner.

# Queries:

<img width="405" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54434a16-d018-4e67-ac3a-2c4992f02160">

Query 1:
Query 1 helps us find the contractors that are working on multiple projects as well as the number of projects they’re working on. This is significant because we need to know each contractor's capacity so that our company can probably allocate resources and plan accordingly. By identifying which contractors are involved in more than one project, the company can properly ensure that they are using all their resources in the most efficient manner and avoid the cost of delays. This is also great for other aspects like viewing performance insights, risk management, contractor relationships, and providing rationale behind satisfaction surveys.

Query 2:
Query 2 provides us with a comprehensive workload overview so that we understand each contractor's task-level accountability. This displays each employee's involvement in the firm and can highlight which contractors are able to handle larger loads of work & efficiently manage their time. Work distribution is another aspect that can be an important find within this query as it can prevent overburdening one contractor with too many tasks and so that we aren’t causing delays or missing deadlines for the overall projects. Lastly, this could be beneficial for vendor management as the contracts working on a high level of tasks could be increasingly valuable to the company, helping the company recruit from within and could be a valuable insight when discussing contracts. 

Query 3:
This query allows managerial staff to get a general overview of all current and active projects assigned to subcontractors. This is vital to any firm seeking to ensure integrity and timely management and project completion. It is crucial to stay on track with deadlines, as permits only have a finite lifespan, and being past due can be costly to everyone involved. Having a general overview can alleviate stress and uncertainty, and can increase timely project completion.

Query 4:
Query 4 helps with revealing the amount of supplies for each project which is useful for project complexity indicators, supplier dependency, and supply chain efficiency. Looking into project complexity indicators, projects with higher supplier amounts could be challenging projects & more complex. This was managers can allocate more time into these projects and focus on these coordinating efforts so that there is smooth collaboration. This is a similar concept with supplier dependency as it allows the company to know which suppliers are able to handle a multitude of tasks and if they are efficiently managing their time. This could influence managers decision making in terms of hiring and whether they should be monitoring the projects closely or not so deadlines are met. Finally, if some projects require less number of suppliers, this means they might have streamlined processes which would impact the supply chain efficiency. 

Query 5:
Query 5 is important since it highlights the landowners with the highest land value, something that could be highly useful. This could provide insight into real estate investments for this company and which owners could be repeat customers, ensuring better asset management as well as decision making for clientele. Similarity, the company is now aware of which owners to prioritize relationships with so that they can find opportunities for future transactions. Second, this supports risk management since the company would know where concentrations of land value differ and lie so they can plan strategically in case of economic shifts in the government.

Query 6:
Query 6 simply ensures project managers and contractors know when to reapply for permits that are useful and necessary to their tasks and projects. This ensures that they are hitting deadlines and are not causing costly delays or damages to any relationships between themselves and their customers. This is a method of proper strategic planning and being prepared so that risk management is up-to-date and they aren’t vulnerable to legal or regulatory setbacks. 

Query 7:
Query 7 is useful because it reveals which supplier helped supply material to each project, based on a specific material in mind. If a finished project turns out to be good or bad, then this query will give the supplier name and their email to either order more materials or send complaints regarding a project that has been built.

Query 8:
Query 8 allows a general contractor  to see which tasks are tied to a specific project. This allows the general contractor to create a plan of action for the tasks in each project. The task description allows the general contractor to see what the goal of each task is, an idea of what materials are needed, and an idea of what subcontractors will be needed. The general contractor will also be able to see which tasks have been started and/or finished.

Query 9:
This query lists all building plans assigned to a specific architecture firm. It is useful to know which architecture firms are handling which building plans and vice versa. If something were to go wrong or something specific needs to be addressed concerning building plans, the management department must be able to reach out to the respective architecture firm that drafted them.

Query 10:
Query 10 is important because it helps management identify which suppliers are currently available to help aid a specific project, because suppliers with no current projects are more likely to deliver materials faster and have them in stock.
